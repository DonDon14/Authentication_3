# Profit Tracking Feature Setup Instructions

## Database Migration Required

Before using the new profit tracking feature, you need to run the SQL migration to add the required database fields.

### Steps:

1. **Run the SQL Migration:**
   - Open your MySQL/phpMyAdmin interface
   - Execute the SQL file: `add_profit_fields_to_contributions.sql`
   - This will add the following fields to the `contributions` table:
     - `cost_price` (DECIMAL) - Cost/expense for the contribution
     - `profit_amount` (DECIMAL) - Calculated profit (amount - cost_price)
     - `profit_margin` (DECIMAL) - Profit margin percentage
     - `profit_calculated_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When profit was last calculated

2. **Verify Installation:**
   - Go to Contributions page: `/contributions`
   - Click "Add Contribution" - you should see the new "Cost Price" field
   - Add a contribution with both amount and cost price
   - You should see profit calculations displayed in real-time

3. **Access Analytics:**
   - In the Contributions page, click the "Profit Analytics" button
   - View comprehensive profit analysis and top performing contributions
